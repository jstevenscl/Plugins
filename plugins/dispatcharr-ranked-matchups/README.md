# Ranked Matchups (Top Games)

A cross-sport "interestingness" curator for Dispatcharr. It pulls upcoming games for each sport you enable, scores every matchup on how interesting it is (rankings, standings, rivalries, betting lines, playoff/knockout stakes), matches the worthwhile games to your existing Dispatcharr channels via EPG, and renames + groups them into a dedicated **Top Matchups** channel profile. Your guide ends up showing the games worth watching instead of the full firehose.

## What it does

- Per-sport adapters (college football/basketball, NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA, NWSL, MLS, top-flight soccer leagues, internationals/friendlies, World Cup, and more), each toggleable.
- Scores matchups with a transparent model (see `SCORING.md` in the source repo): ranked-vs-ranked, standings importance, rivalries, and betting-line signal where available.
- Matches scored games to your channels through EPG and builds a curated **Top Matchups** profile with clean, renamed entries.
- Runs on demand from the plugin UI or on a schedule.

## Requirements

- Most sources need a free API key (e.g. CollegeFootballData / CollegeBasketballData, Football-Data.org, The Odds API). Each sport's setting documents which key it needs; sports you do not enable need no key.
- Off-season sports simply produce no rows.
