## Warning: back up your database first

This plugin renames, moves and can permanently delete channels. Before using it,
**[make a backup of your Dispatcharr database](https://dispatcharr.github.io/Dispatcharr-Docs/troubleshooting/?h=backup#how-can-i-make-a-backup-of-the-database)**.

## What it does

Probes every stream behind your channels with `ffprobe`, records what it finds, and lets you act on
the result.

**It answers three questions per stream**, and keeps them apart because acting on the wrong one
deletes channels that work:

- **Alive.** The stream plays. Resolution, framerate, codecs and bitrate are recorded and synced
  back into Dispatcharr so the channel menu can show them.
- **Dead.** The stream does not play, or it plays but shows nothing worth watching: a blank picture,
  a frozen picture, silence, or a fixed-duration placeholder file. Those last four are opt-in.
- **Skipped.** The checker could not judge it. That covers a provider rate-limit response, a
  radio station with no video track, and hosts `ffprobe` cannot read at all. **Skipped is never
  treated as dead**, so nothing destructive touches a stream that was merely throttled.

**A channel is judged by all of its streams, never by one of them.** Most channels carry a primary
and one or more backups, and Dispatcharr fails over between them. A channel is only reported dead
when **every** stream failed, so one dead backup never marks a working channel for deletion.

Other things it does:

- **Scheduled checks**, including overnight windows that pause at a set time and resume where they
  left off on the next window.
- **An HTML report** written to `/config/iptv_checker/report.html`, grouped by what you should do
  about each finding, and optionally emailed through the
  [Newsflasharr](https://github.com/PiratesIRC) plugin.
- **CSV export** with a full settings preamble, so every run leaves an audit record.
- **Rename, move, restore and delete** actions, each with its own confirmation.
- **Self-healing**: a channel that comes back to life is renamed back and moved to its original
  group automatically.

## Requirements

- Dispatcharr v0.20.0 or newer, with channels and groups already configured.
- **`ffprobe`** in the container. **`ffmpeg`** as well if you enable blank-screen, frozen-video or
  silent-audio detection.
- `pytz` for the scheduler, which is normally already present.

```bash
docker exec dispatcharr which ffprobe
docker exec dispatcharr which ffmpeg
```

No API credentials are needed. The plugin runs inside Dispatcharr with direct database access.

## Install

1. Log in to Dispatcharr and go to **Plugins**.
2. Click **Import Plugin** and upload the release zip.
3. Enable the plugin.

**To update**, delete the old plugin in the Plugins page, restart the container
(`docker restart dispatcharr`), then import the new zip. Your settings are preserved.

## Quick start

1. Set **Channel Groups** and **Channel Groups Mode**. Leave the box empty to check every group.
2. Click **Validate** to confirm the plugin can see your groups. It reports how many groups will be
   checked.
3. Click **Load Groups**, then **Start Check**.
4. Watch **View Progress**, then read **View Results** or **Email Report**.

## Documentation

**[Full user guide](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-IPTV-Checker-Plugin/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md)** covers every setting and button, the detection modes,
scheduling and windowed runs, the HTML report and email delivery, and troubleshooting.

## Versioning

Calver `1.26.{DDD}{HHMM}`, being the UTC day-of-year and UTC hour-minute, matching the Lineuparr,
Channel-Mapparr and EPG-Janitor plugins. Releases before `1.26.1081815` used semver.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. When reporting a problem, please include your Dispatcharr
version, the relevant container logs
(`docker logs dispatcharr | grep "IPTV Checker"`), and the exact error text.

Contribution steps, the CI gates, and how updates reach the Dispatcharr plugin marketplace are in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-IPTV-Checker-Plugin/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Disclaimer

This plugin makes bulk changes to your channel database, including permanent deletion when you
enable it. Test on a small group first, keep a database backup, and read what an action says it will
do before confirming it.
