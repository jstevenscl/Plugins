"""Report model and rendering for Channel-Maparr's emailed reports.

Newsflasharr sends an attachment verbatim and unredacted, so anything reaching
this model can leave the box by email. Two structural decisions follow from that,
and both are pinned by tests:

The model is built by COPYING a named allow-list of columns out of the row dicts
the actions already hold in memory. It is never built by reading a CSV export.
The exports in /data/exports open with a settings header that names the
configured M3U sources, which on a real installation is the provider hostname,
so a report built by re-reading an export would carry that hostname by
construction. Building from an allow-list also means a column added to a CSV
writer later cannot start being emailed on its own.

The account-name scrub is the PRIMARY redaction input here, not a backstop. In
Stream-Mapparr the raw stream names never carried an account label and the scrub
was a second line of defence, so an empty account list degraded safely. That is
not true here, so build_model refuses when the account name list is None, which
is how a caller reports that the lookup failed.

# changes, and the fade applies to everything nested inside.
#
# Spacing picks a step off --s1 to --s5. The steps sit about a third apart
# because a linear ramp makes small steps look identical and large ones look
# arbitrary.

# The palette below, and the two surface colours it was measured against, were

# of these repositories, so the numbers CANNOT be re-derived here. Reuse a
# semantic slot rather than inventing a hex. tests/test_report_style.py pins
# every one of them, and pins the ink ramp separately: --ink-dim is the weakest
