"""Channel-Maparr's emit layer for the Newsflasharr notification service.

This module owns the guard boundary. The vendored client's notify() never
raises, but the code around it can, and a bug here must never break
Channel-Maparr's real work. Every public function in this file is written so a
failure is reported rather than thrown.

Settings are read from the dict passed in on every call and never cached on an
instance. A value primed on one entry path and read back with getattr on another
fails silently, with no crash and no log line, which is a failure this codebase
has shipped before.

Stream-Mapparr's scheduled-run timestamp file is deliberately not reproduced
here. It exists there to prove a schedule is still alive, because Newsflasharr's
own absence detector stamps a timestamp on any successful attachment send and
cannot tell a scheduled run from a button press. Channel-Maparr has no scheduler
at all, so such a file would prove nothing.
