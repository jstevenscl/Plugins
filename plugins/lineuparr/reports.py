"""Report model and rendering for Lineuparr.

Renders one run's results as a self-contained HTML page with a sortable table,
and as a CSV. This is separate from the plugin's own CSV export in
/data/exports: that file opens with a settings header naming the configured M3U
sources, which on a real installation is the provider's hostname, so it is a
local file and not something to hand around.

Two structural decisions follow from the report being shareable, and both are
pinned by tests:

The model is built by COPYING a named allow-list of columns out of the row dicts
the actions already hold in memory. It is never built by re-reading an export.
Building from an allow-list also means a column added to a CSV writer later
cannot start appearing in a shared report on its own.

The M3U account-name scrub is a PRIMARY redaction input here, not a backstop. A
stream name frequently carries its own account label, so build_model refuses when
the account name list is None, which is how a caller reports that the lookup
failed. An empty list is a different thing and is allowed: an installation can
legitimately have no active M3U accounts.

#
# THE TOKEN LAYER, adopted from the Dustarr plugin's report. Four rules govern
# it, and each one was a real defect in that plugin before it was fixed:
#
#   Spacing is a scale. Every margin, padding and gap picks --s1 to --s5. The
#   steps are about a third apart, because a linear ramp makes small steps look
#   identical and large ones look arbitrary.
#
#   No opacity for text hierarchy. Use --ink, --ink-muted, --ink-dim. An
#   opacity value paints a different colour on every surface it lands on, so
#   the contrast ratio moves silently whenever a background changes, and the
#   fade applies to everything nested inside. The ramp is 5.24:1 at its weakest
#   against the light surface, over the 4.5:1 floor. Opacity remains fine for a
#   decorative fill that carries no text.
#
#   Light and dark differ only in token values. Needing !important means the
#   tokens are wrong.
#
#   No literal colour inside a rule. Light and dark cannot both be right about
#   one. Literals appear only in the two :root blocks.
#
# The category colours and the two surface colours were validated all pairs for
# colourblind safety against those exact surfaces, with a validator that is not
# in this repository. THE NUMBERS ARE NOT RE-DERIVABLE HERE. Reuse the semantic
# slots for new categories rather than inventing a hex value.
