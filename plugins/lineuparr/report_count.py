"""Publishes the count of reports this plugin has built, for Newsflasharr to show.

THE CONTRACT, which is Newsflasharr's to read and ours to write:

    /data/lineuparr/report_count.json   ->   {"reports_built": 42}

One key, one non-negative JSON integer. That is the whole interface. The reader
is newsflasharr/report_count.py in the Newsflasharr repository, it degrades to
showing nothing on every unexpected condition, and it reports no error when it
does. So every rule below is load bearing even though breaking one looks like
nothing at all:

  - the value must be a JSON integer, not a float, because int(2.9) is 2 and a
    silent under-report looks deliberate;
  - it must not be a JSON boolean, because bool subclasses int in Python and
    true would display as "1 built";
  - it must be zero or greater, and zero is legal;
  - the top level must be a JSON object;
  - the whole file must stay under 4096 bytes, which the reader checks before
    it reads, because it runs on an operator click inside a uWSGI worker where
    a blocking read freezes every greenlet in that process;
  - the file must be a regular file readable by user dispatch.

An absent file is not an error. It means no count is shown, which is the right
display for a plugin that publishes no counter.

WHAT THE NUMBER COUNTS. Reports whose files were confirmed written to disk, one
per successful build, whether an operator pressed the button or a scheduled job
ran it. A build that failed to write must not increment it. That distinction is
the point: write_report degrades instead of raising, so a failed publish looks
identical to a good one from the outside, and a counter that incremented anyway
would turn that failure into apparent success.

NO LOCKING, DELIBERATELY. The read, add one, write sequence here is unlocked
across several uWSGI and Celery workers, so two reports finishing in the same
instant can lose an increment, and an unlucky interleaving can even publish a
value one lower than the one already on disk: a worker that read N while two
others advanced the file to N+2 goes on to write N+1. The next increment heals
it. That is accepted. The number is a floor, not an audit, and a file lock on a
request path is a worse trade for a cosmetic number. Do not "fix" this by
adding one.

NO FSYNC, ALSO DELIBERATELY. Measured on this installation inside the
container: the write sequence below costs 0.26 ms without an fsync and 5.16 ms
with one, rising to a 29.5 ms ninetieth percentile and a 39 ms maximum while
another process is writing to the same filesystem. An fsync pays for a journal
commit, not for the twenty bytes, and /data carries the PostgreSQL data
directory on the same ext4 filesystem, so it waits behind whatever else is in
the current transaction. uWSGI here runs gevent with 400 async cores across two
workers, so that wait freezes an entire worker and every stream it is proxying,
on the path of an operator button click. The report this counts is not fsynced
either. Losing a cosmetic increment to a host crash is the cheaper failure.

NOTHING HERE EVER RAISES INTO THE REPORT PATH. Failing to publish the counter
must not fail the report that was just written.

    afterwards, so there is no moment at which it is more readable than
    intended, and os.replace carries that mode to the destination, narrowing an
    existing file that somehow had a wider one.

    The temporary name carries this process's id AND this thread's id rather
    than random characters. A worker killed between the create and the rename
    would otherwise leave a uniquely named file that nothing ever cleans up; a
    per-thread name is reused by that thread's next write instead.

    The thread id is not decoration. Dispatcharr's dvr Celery worker runs a
    thread pool, so two of its threads share one process id, and a name built
    from the process id alone would have them truncating each other's temporary
    file. The later close would then flush at its own offset and the rename
    could publish padding bytes followed by valid JSON.
